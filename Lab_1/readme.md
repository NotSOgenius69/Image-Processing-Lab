<h1>Assignment 01</h1>
<h2>Gaussian Image Convolution</h2>

In this assignment , i generated a smoothing and sharpening kernel from gaussian smoothing and sharpening function and then convolved with
a RGB and HSV image to see the results. Applied the effect to each R,G,B channel separately and then merged them to see the final output.

<h2>Outputs</h2>
