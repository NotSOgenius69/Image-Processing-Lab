<h1>Assignment 01</h1>
<h2>Detecting Edges Using zero crossing and thresholding local variance map</h2>

In this assignment, a grayscale image is taken and we apply convolution with Laplacian of Gaussian(LoG) filter at first. Then we apply
zero crossing to find the abrupt change of pixel values indicating edges. Later we calculate the local variance at each zero crossing 
point and generate a local variance map. Finally we apply thresholding on the local variance map to detect the edges.
